            We believe in building innovative technology that feels familiar,
            natural, and human. Technology that improves the human experience
            and is born from good intentions. Products that put us back in touch
            with ourselves, each other, and the world around us. Experiences
            that are built on trust with interactions that feel magical, and
            bring joy. Humane is the next shift between humans and computing.
            The best human experience, ever.
